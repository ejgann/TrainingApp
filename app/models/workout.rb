  # want to order the 'all workouts' view by popularity (i.e. number of trainings associated with that workout)
  # to count the number of trainings of an associated workout => @workout.trainings.count
  # .order -- desc
  # because it involves a join table, we have to incorporate joins + model into the scope method
